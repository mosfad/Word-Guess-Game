## Guess the name of a film title from the 90s. ##
This program engages the user in a word guess game. The program picks a random film title from the 90s, and gives the user a limited number of guesses to discern the film title. If the user successfully guesses the correct film title, then the program records the round as a win and updates the win total and plays a clip of the corresponding film. The user can continue to play multiple rounds, as the game tracks the number of wins. The user can completely reset the game by refreshing the browser.

The program is a wonderful way to improve your powers of deduction and reminesce about the films that influenced popular culture in the 90s. You also get to kick back and enjoy the theme songs and captivating moments shown in the clips, if you successfully win a round.

*Please start the game by pressing the space bar*. The program will then randomly pick a film title and display the number of guesses for the round. Press any letter key to start guessing. The letters guessed will be displayed for the user to track all the guesses. Note that repeated guesses are not displayed and do not affect the number of guesses left; also, other characters such as 'Tab', 'Shift', and so on, do not affect the number of guesses left. If the user wins the round or has exhausted all the guesses, *please press the space bar again to start a new round*.
